# EEP_596_Project2
# Deep Learning-Based ECG Heartbeat Classification for Arrhythmia Detection

## Project Overview:
This repository contains Project 2 for the course EE P 596: Advanced Introduction to Machine Learning. The project, instructed by Prof. Karthik Mohan, was completed by students Naif A Ganadily and Sarah Selim, with assistance from TA Ayush Singh and Grader Fatwir SM.

This project employs deep learning techniques to accurately classify distinct heartbeat types from electrocardiogram (ECG) data, with the primary aim of assisting in arrhythmia diagnosis.

## Data Preprocessing and Visualization
The workflow encompasses several stages, such as data preprocessing, visualization, addressing class imbalance, feature extraction, and model training and evaluation.

## Handling Class Imbalance and Feature Extraction
The dataset undergoes normalization and class imbalance assessment, which is tackled through random under-sampling and data augmentation methods.

## Machine Learning Models and Evaluation
Two machine learning models, logistic regression and random forest, are trained and evaluated on the processed data.

## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model
A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is constructed using the Keras library in TensorFlow, featuring multiple convolutional and dense layers, and assessed on the same dataset.

## Performance Metrics and Visualization
The project encompasses functions for computing and visualizing false positive and false negative results for Class R, offering valuable insights into the model's performance.

## Conclusion
In summary, this project showcases the promising potential of deep learning in the precise classification of heartbeats and arrhythmia diagnosis.
